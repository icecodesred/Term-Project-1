For the Term project, I chose a dataset on Shakespeare plays from relational-data.org.

source: https://relational-data.org/dataset/Shakespeare

I exported the csv files from the dataset after connecting with the credentials available on the site, 
then loaded the csv files into my local instance. The project is reproducible doing the same steps.

I chose this dataset because I think there might be some new insights in these works, and literature in general,
while using quantitative methods to present data, like words by character. 
For analysis, I used basic procedures to count words by character and count paragraphs. Later, this could be transformed into
statistical data to learn new information.
